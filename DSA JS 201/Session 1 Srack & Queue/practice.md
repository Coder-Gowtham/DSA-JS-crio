STACKS:
Frequently asked problems
Tree traversals without using recursion (Recursion uses function call stack, use stack explicitly as an alternative to that)
Postfix, Infix and Prefix conversions
Expression evaluation
Balanced Parentheses problem
Next Greater/Smaller Element
Implement stack using 2 queues
Implement the min() function using a Stack
Sort the values in a Stack
Find the next day with higher temperature
Decode an encoded string (repeating values encoded with a number)

How to identify Stack problems?
If you need to keep track of the previous elements in the order in which they occurred.



QUEUES:
Applications
Queues - Kafka, RabbitMQ
The consumer who comes first to a shop will be served first. 
CPU task scheduling and disk scheduling.
Waiting list of tickets in case of bus and train tickets.
FIFO requests to shared resources like CPU, Disk access or Printers
Scheduling algorithms
Search algorithms - E.g. BFS

Library methods In different languages
add() - Inserts the specified element into the queue. 
peek() - Returns the head of the queue. 
remove() - Returns and removes the head of the queue. 
poll() - Returns and removes the head of the queue.


Frequently asked problems
Level Order Traversal without using recursion
BFS without using recursion
Queue Implementation using a Linked List
Implement a stack using the queue data structure
Implement a queue using the stack data structure / 2 stacks
Reverse first k elements of queue
Find the moving average of fixed size window
Design circular queue
How to identify Queue problems?
Queue problems usually call for use of Queue explicitly
