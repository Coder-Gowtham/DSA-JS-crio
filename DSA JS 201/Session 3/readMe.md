Hash:
Applications
Hash Functions are used in various algorithms to make their computing faster
Associative arrays: Hash tables are commonly used to implement many types of in-memory tables. They are used to implement associative arrays (arrays whose indices are arbitrary strings or other complicated objects).
Database indexing: Hash tables may also be used as disk-based data structures and database indices (such as in dbm). Databases may use hash to support quick lookups
Caches: Hash tables can be used to implement caches i.e. auxiliary data tables that are used to speed up the access to data, which is primarily stored in slower media.
Object representation: Several dynamic languages, such as Perl, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby use hash tables to implement objects.
Tiny URL creation - A shortened URL which can be resolved uniquely to a larger URL.
Cryptography and checksums
Speeding up data lookup e.g. Dictionaries

How to identify Hash problems?
If you need to keep track of count of a particular element (Hash Map) or track occurrence of elements (Hash Set), you should consider Hash.
Many problems involving two for loops O(n*n) can be done in O(n) , if we find a way to maintain a map/array and make use of it.
