1.	String.slice(2) || String.slice(1,2)
2.	String.indexOf(char)
3.	String.split(“”) //splits into multiple string(arrays)
4.	String.includes(subStr)
5.	String.startsWith()
6.	String.endsWith()
7.	String.trim()
8.	String.replace()
9.	String.substring()

#SUB-STRING
    - Has to be a continuous characters in a string.
    - "abcdef" => "abc", "cde" ...etc

#SUB-SEQUENCE
    - Doesn't have to be continuous, pick anything you like but in order
    - "abcdef" => "bcef" is a subsequence
    - every substring is a subsequence, but every subsequence is not a substring
